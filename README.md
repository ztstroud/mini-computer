# Mini Computer
This project contains simulated hardware and software of my own design. It serves as a vessel for me to understand
computers and programming languages.

You can read a curated version of my thoughts on my website at https://zakstroud.com/projects/mini-computer.

## Tools
This project uses [Digital](https://github.com/hneemann/Digital) to simulate hardware.

## Structure
At the top level, there are folders that contain different hardware implementations. These contain several different
files.

### `hardware.dig`
The Digital file describing the hardware. This file can be opened with Digital to simulate the computer.

### `INSTR.md`
A markdown file that documents the instructions supported by the simulated hardware.

### `HARDWARE.md`
A markdown file that documents details about the hardware.
